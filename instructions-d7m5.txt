Complete all the homeworks from last week (including extras 😜), then deploy it on cloud.


☁️ CLOUD
We want to make applications available for the general public and production ready 🚗⚡



Deploy everything on HEROKU and VERCEL, with CLOUDINARY as CDN



⚠️ If you have troubles with running on heroku remind to configure start scripts in package.json

⚠️ ⚠️ Remind to use environment variables both locally and remotely

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ Configure CORS properly to make them work together.
