Strive Blog API
If not done yet, please host backend on Heroku and frontend on Vercel ☁️. Today's goal is to add the feature to export a blog post content into a PDF file.

 

 

BACKEND
Create an endpoint dedicated to export all the relevant data of a blog post into a well styled downloadable PDF file.
 

[EXTRA] add blog post image to PDF too
 

You can find an example blog post as pdf in attachment.
 

FRONTEND
Create an anchor tag on single blog post page to permit PDF download
