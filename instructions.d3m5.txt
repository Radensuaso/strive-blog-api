Strive Blog API


You are in charge of creating a set of WebAPIs for the Strive Blog application.

Here you can find the Frontend already created







In this second "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of blog posts





Blog posts should contain following information:





{
	    "_id": "SERVER GENERATED ID",
	    "category": "ARTICLE CATEGORY",
	    "title": "ARTICLE TITLE",
	    "cover":"ARTICLE COVER (IMAGE LINK)",
	    "readTime": {
	      "value": 2,
	      "unit": "minute"
	    },
	    "author": {
	      "name": "AUTHOR AVATAR NAME",
	      "avatar":"AUTHOR AVATAR LINK"
	    },
	    "content": "HTML",
	    "createdAt": "NEW DATE"
	  }


Backend


The backend should include the following routes:



GET /blogPosts => returns the list of blogposts
GET /blogPosts /123 => returns a single blogpost
POST /blogPosts => create a new blogpost
PUT /blogPosts /123 => edit the blogpost with the given id
DELETE /blogPosts /123 => delete the blogpost with the given id


The persistence must be granted via file system (es.: Json file with a list of blog posts inside)



Sidenote: remember to install the cors package with 'npm i cors', to import it and to use it with 'server.use(cors())'





⚠️ Bodies, params and queries must be validated with express-validator middleware
