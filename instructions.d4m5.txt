Backend
Comments are going to be embedded in the corresponding blog post, so add a comments array on every post (empty at the beginning). They should contain just author name and text



The backend should include the following routes:

POST /authors/:id/uploadAvatar, uploads a picture (save as idOfTheAuthor.jpg in the public/img/authors folder) for the author specified by the id. Store the newly created URL into the corresponding author in authors.json
POST /blogPosts/:id/uploadCover, uploads a picture (save as idOfTheBlogPost.jpg in the public/img/blogPosts folder) for the blog post specified by the id. Store the newly created URL into the corresponding post in blogPosts.json
GET /blogPosts/:id/comments, get all the comments for a specific post
POST /blogPosts/:id/comments, add a new comment to the specific post




The persistence must be granted via file system
